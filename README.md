# Fairy Flood! 🧚‍♀️🌧️✨
## Mini Game Project by Jasmine

### Synopsis 🧚‍♀️
You are a gem fairy, a fairy whose job is to collect rare gems that appear during
thunderstorms. Avoid raindrops and seek shelter from the friendly rain cloud above on your
journey to collect as many gems as possible.

### Points Mechanism 🏆
Points are earned by collecting crystals and points are lost by being hit
by raindrops. So try your best not to get hit by one!

### Tip 🎮
You can hide where the screen wraps, but not for long! Raindrops can hit you there
too!
